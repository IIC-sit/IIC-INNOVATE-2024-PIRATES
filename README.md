## Project Description

The Blockchain-based E-waste Tracking System is an innovative solution addressing the 
critical global challenge of managing electronic waste (e-waste). E-waste, comprising 
discarded electronic devices such as phones, computers, and appliances, is one of the 
fastest-growing waste streams globally. Improper disposal of these items results in severe 
environmental pollution, hazardous health conditions, and significant economic losses due 
to the waste of valuable materials such as gold, copper, and silver. 

Despite existing regulations and awareness campaigns, e-waste recycling rates remain low, 
primarily due to inefficiencies in waste tracking, lack of transparency, and insufficient 
incentives for proper disposal. Traditional systems are prone to data tampering and often 
fail to ensure accountability among stakeholders. 

To address these issues, this project leverages blockchain technology. By 
creating a decentralized, tamper-proof system for tracking e-waste across its lifecycle—from 
manufacturing to disposal or recycling—it ensures transparency, compliance, and 
accountability. Smart contracts enable the automation of regulatory checks and reward 
mechanisms, motivating stakeholders to adopt eco-friendly practices. The system ultimately 
aims to foster sustainability, reduce environmental harm, and encourage the recovery of 
valuable resources.
